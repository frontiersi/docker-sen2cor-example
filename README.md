## Notes
* If the run fails with an error like `[CRITICAL]  L2A_Config: 3181   Error in creating L2A User Product` then this may mean your granules don't have the `AUX_DATA` or `HTML` folders. The files I downloaded from CreoDIAS didn't have the `AUX_DATA` folders, so I created them, and it seems to work.
